This repository demonstrates a common Python bug involving type errors during list processing. The `bug.py` file shows the initial code with the error, which fails when the input list contains non-numeric values.  The `bugSolution.py` file provides a solution that gracefully handles this scenario using error handling.  This example highlights the importance of input validation and exception handling in robust Python programming.
